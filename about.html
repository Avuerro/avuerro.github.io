## About Me

Hi there <img class="emoji" title=":wave:" alt=":wave:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" height="20" width="20"> <br>
I'm Chihab, I graduated in Artificial Intelligence and I'm mostly interested in 
the field of Computer Vision, especially 3D Scene Representations. 
However, I also enjoy working and learning about the following subjects; Algorithms &amp; Datastructures, Software Development and, Data Scraping and Analytics.

The purpose of this webpage is quite simple, throughout the years I have learned quite some concepts but what I learned most 
is how easy it is to forget these concepts. 
This page will therefore serve as a repository (or archive) of things I should know by heart, furthermore,
I will also share some fun and interesting projects I have been working on.
It is currently still a <b>work in progress</b> and will be updated over time.
